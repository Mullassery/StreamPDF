# StreamPDF

**The Intelligence Engine for PDFs**

StreamPDF is a high-performance PDF intelligence platform that enables AI agents to retrieve, understand, and process PDF documents without requiring full document conversion.

Instead of converting entire PDFs to markdown, StreamPDF intelligently identifies relevant sections and converts only what's needed — dramatically reducing compute, storage, and token costs.

## The Problem

Modern PDF processing pipelines are wasteful:

```
Traditional RAG:
1. Convert entire PDF to markdown
2. Generate embeddings for all content
3. Store complete document
4. Retrieve small portions on demand

Result: 
- Process 100% of document
- Use only 1% of retrieved content
```

StreamPDF solves this:

```
StreamPDF:
1. Analyze PDF structure
2. Retrieve relevant pages (not full document)
3. Convert only selected pages to markdown
4. Optimize context for AI consumption

Result:
- Process only 5-10% of document
- Same or better accuracy
- 10-50x lower token consumption
```

## Core Vision

**Build the retrieval engine for PDFs.**

Not PDF parsing. Not PDF-to-Markdown conversion. But intelligent PDF access that makes RAG systems dramatically faster, cheaper, and more efficient.

### 10 Strategic Pillars

1. **PDF-Native Retrieval** — Understand structure before converting
2. **Page-Level Intelligence** — Find relevant pages instantly
3. **Dynamic Markdown** — Generate only what's needed
4. **Token Efficiency** — Minimize token consumption
5. **Large Documents** — Optimized for books and manuals
6. **Security-Aware** — Handle encrypted and protected PDFs
7. **Agent-Native** — APIs designed for AI systems
8. **Multi-Method Retrieval** — Combine semantic, structural, and keyword search
9. **Knowledge Index** — Lightweight persistent understanding
10. **RAG Infrastructure** — Foundation layer for PDF-based AI systems

## The Insight

Most questions require less than 1% of a PDF.

Most AI systems currently process 100% anyway.

StreamPDF changes that fundamental inefficiency.
