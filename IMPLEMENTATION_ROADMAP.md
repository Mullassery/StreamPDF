## RESEARCH PHASE: Competitive Benchmarking & Validation (Weeks -4 to 0) — 160 hours

**Critical:** This phase must complete BEFORE Phase 1a. Our roadmap depends on validating competitive assumptions.

### Goal
Understand exactly what we're competing against and validate that StreamPDF can beat the best (LlamaParse, Docling, Marker) on speed, cost, and quality.

### 1. Competitor Research & Benchmarking

**1.1 LlamaParse (The Cloud Benchmark)**
- [ ] Collect actual pricing (all costs: per-page, API, etc.)
- [ ] Benchmark parsing speed:
  - [ ] Simple PDFs (1-10 pages)
  - [ ] Medium PDFs (100-300 pages)
  - [ ] Large PDFs (1000 pages)
  - [ ] Monster PDFs (10,000+ pages)
- [ ] Benchmark quality:
  - [ ] Table extraction accuracy (simple, nested, complex)
  - [ ] Text accuracy (simple vs complex layouts)
  - [ ] Heading hierarchy preservation
  - [ ] Figure/image detection
  - [ ] Formula handling
- [ ] Identify failure modes (what breaks LlamaParse?)
- [ ] Document latency (cloud round-trip timing)
- [ ] Real user feedback (what do customers complain about?)

**Deliverable:** LlamaParse benchmark report (5-10 page analysis)

---

**1.2 Docling (The Open-Source Challenger)**
- [ ] Collect performance metrics:
  - [ ] Parsing speed (various PDF sizes)
  - [ ] Memory usage (peak and sustained)
  - [ ] CPU usage
- [ ] Benchmark accuracy:
  - [ ] Table extraction (claimed strength)
  - [ ] Text extraction (vs LlamaParse)
  - [ ] Layout preservation
- [ ] Identify failure modes (edge cases, problematic PDFs)
- [ ] Analyze code:
  - [ ] Architecture (why is it heavy?)
  - [ ] Dependencies (what's required?)
  - [ ] Parallelization capabilities
- [ ] Roadmap analysis (what are they building?)

**Deliverable:** Docling technical analysis (compare to LlamaParse)

---

**1.3 PyMuPDF4LLM (The Recent Entry)**
- [ ] Verify speed claims (benchmark ourselves)
- [ ] Quality assessment (simple PDFs vs complex)
- [ ] Community adoption tracking
- [ ] Roadmap analysis (will they add features?)

**Deliverable:** PyMuPDF4LLM assessment

---

**1.4 Other Competitors (Azure, AWS, Marker, Unstructured)**
- [ ] Quick assessment (1-2 pages each)
- [ ] Pricing comparison
- [ ] Identify strengths/weaknesses

**Deliverable:** Competitive landscape summary

---

### 2. PDF Parsing Library Research

**2.1 Technical Deep Dive: Parsing Libraries**

Which parsing library gives us the best foundation?

- [ ] **pdfium-render** (Chromium's PDF engine via C++ FFI)
  - Pros: Battle-tested, handles complex layouts, LlamaParse uses it
  - Cons: FFI overhead, external dependency
  - Performance: Expected 50-200ms for 1000-page PDF
  - Research: Verify performance claims, FFI overhead

- [ ] **pdf-rs** (Pure Rust PDF parsing)
  - Pros: No external dependencies, pure Rust
  - Cons: Doesn't handle all PDF features
  - Performance: Likely slower than pdfium
  - Research: Can it match quality/speed needs?

- [ ] **pypdf** (Python fallback)
  - Pros: Easy integration
  - Cons: Performance bottleneck
  - Performance: Too slow for v1.0 target
  - Research: Verify performance ceiling

**Deliverable:** PDF library comparison matrix

**Success Criteria:**
- Choose primary library (likely pdfium-render)
- Validate it can hit speed targets (<500ms for 1000 pages)
- Document tradeoffs

---

**2.2 Architecture Decision: Memory Model**

How do we keep constant memory on large PDFs?

- [ ] Research streaming approaches
  - [ ] Page-by-page streaming
  - [ ] Chunk-by-chunk streaming
  - [ ] Memory-mapped access
- [ ] Compare to competitors
  - [ ] How does Docling handle 10,000-page PDFs? (It doesn't optimize for this)
  - [ ] How does LlamaParse handle large documents? (Cloud-based, different model)
- [ ] Prototype memory usage patterns
  - [ ] 100-page PDF: Target <50MB
  - [ ] 1000-page PDF: Target <200MB
  - [ ] 10,000-page PDF: Target <500MB

**Deliverable:** Memory architecture proposal

---

### 3. Define Success Metrics (Measurable vs Claims)

Convert our roadmap promises into measurable benchmarks:

| Promise | Measurable Metric | Target | How We'll Verify |
|---------|------------------|--------|------------------|
| Faster than LlamaParse | Parse 1000-page PDF | <400ms | Benchmark script |
| Cheaper than LlamaParse | Cost per 1000 pages | $0 (free) | Licensing |
| Better than Docling | Memory on 1000 pages | <200MB | Memory profiler |
| Handles 10,000 pages | Parse time | <2s | Benchmark script |
| Quality matches leaders | Table extraction | >90% accuracy | Test suite on benchmark PDFs |
| Fast queries | Page search latency | <100ms | Benchmark script |

**Deliverable:** Validated success metrics for roadmap

---

### 4. Test Data Preparation

Build benchmark dataset for ongoing validation:

- [ ] Collect 100 diverse PDFs:
  - [ ] Simple PDFs (1-10 pages, basic layout)
  - [ ] Medium PDFs (100-300 pages)
  - [ ] Large PDFs (1000+ pages)
  - [ ] Complex PDFs (nested tables, multi-column)
  - [ ] Difficult PDFs (scanned, handwritten, mixed)
  - [ ] Edge cases (huge images, formulas, unusual fonts)

- [ ] For each PDF, document:
  - [ ] Expected table extraction accuracy
  - [ ] Expected text accuracy
  - [ ] Known challenges
  - [ ] LlamaParse performance
  - [ ] Docling performance

**Deliverable:** Benchmark dataset + metadata

---

### 5. Roadmap Validation & Adjustment

Based on research, validate assumptions:

**Questions to answer:**
- [ ] Can we actually beat LlamaParse on speed? (Or should we claim "competitive"?)
- [ ] Can we match Docling on quality? (Or should we focus on efficiency?)
- [ ] What's our realistic v1.0 timeline?
- [ ] Are there competitors we didn't know about?
- [ ] Did the market shift (e.g., PyMuPDF4LLM gaining adoption)?
- [ ] What features matter most to users?
- [ ] Where should we invest for differentiation?

**Adjust roadmap based on findings:**
- If LlamaParse is faster than expected → Phase 1a gets more time
- If Docling quality is better → Adjust Phase 1b timeline
- If PyMuPDF4LLM is gaining traction → Adjust market positioning
- If we find performance ceiling → May need different library

**Deliverable:** Updated roadmap based on research

---

### 6. Community & Market Research

- [ ] Interview 10-20 RAG builders:
  - [ ] What are they currently using? (LlamaParse? Docling?)
  - [ ] What's their main pain? (Cost? Speed? Quality?)
  - [ ] What would make them switch?
  - [ ] How many PDFs do they process monthly?
  - [ ] What's their document size range?

- [ ] Monitor GitHub/Hacker News:
  - [ ] Adoption trends (which tools growing?)
  - [ ] User feedback (what are complaints?)
  - [ ] Feature requests (what's missing?)

**Deliverable:** Market insights document
